        <body>Client side rendering requires large bundles loaded on clients. They are resource intensive. Also less secure bc info available client-side. SSR: smaller bundles, more resource efficient, search-index optimized. SSR components can't listen to browser events, access browser APIs, maintain state, or use effects. Only use CSR when absolutely needed. Can extract tiny components to client to minimize CSR bits and maximize SSR.</body>

'use client';</body> */}
